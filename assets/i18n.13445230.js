Halal certification is a scientific method to test whether food contains substances that are not allowed by Islamic law. Products that pass the test can obtain the official certification mark. When importing through the customs, relevant documents must be submitted to enter the halal food area. When participating in the food exhibition of Muslim countries, the products can also be displayed in the halal area. From this point of view, halal certification is a stepping stone for manufacturers to enter the vast Muslim food market.",whatIsHalalP2:"The central theme of halal certification is from the place of origin to the table, halal food must not be contaminated with illegal substances, so as to ensure that the food consumed by consumers meets the requirements of their religion.
