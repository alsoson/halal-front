  whatIsHalalP: 'Since the Sharia law has special regulations on the food eaten by Muslims, there is a need for halal certification. Halal certification is a scientific method to test whether food contains substances that are not allowed by Islamic law. Products that pass the test can obtain the official certification mark. When importing through the customs, relevant documents must be submitted to enter the halal food area. When participating in the food exhibition of Muslim countries, the products can also be displayed in the halal area. From this point of view, halal certification is a stepping stone for manufacturers to enter the vast Muslim food market.',

  whatIsHalalP2: "The central theme of halal certification is from the place of origin to the table, halal food must not be contaminated with illegal substances, so as to ensure that the food consumed by consumers meets the requirements of their religion. From the owner's point of view, halal certification is not only whether the product terminal test contains illegal substances, but more importantly, whether the raw materials are also halal and free from pollution. In the process of food production and processing, whether there is a clear separation from illegal substances.",

  whatIsHalalP3: 'After food production, whether there is cross-contamination with illegal substances in the process of logistics, transportation and freezing. Finally, when halal food is cooked and sold, is it properly separated from illegal substances during the production process. In conclusion, halal certification is more concerned with whether the food meets the halal requirements at every level from raw materials to the production process, not only the terminal products meet the halal certification',

  aboutMuslimP: 'Islam is currently the top three religions in the world. Islam, also known as Islam, halalism, and heavenly religion, was originally founded by Muhammad. The word Muhammad in Arabic refers to a highly praised person. In addition, the origin of the word Islam can be traced back to the book of the Qur an, which means follow, submission, peace; and those who obey the will of Allah, we call them Muslims.',

  aboutMuslimP2: 'Muslims implement their beliefs in their daily lives. The "Five Gongs" are the five basic principles that Muslims need to abide by, namely "chanting, ritual, fasting, prayer, and morning", which means "chanting, worship, fasting, zakat and pilgrimage',
  aboutMuslimP3: "There are three holy places in Islam: Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. When Muhammad founded and spread Islam in Mecca, due to opposition and persecution, he moved to Yas-rib in AD 622 and changed his name to Medina-Nabi, referring to the city of the prophets, referred to as “Medina”. There are many monuments here, the most famous of which is the Prophet's Mosque built under the supervision of Muhammad, also known as Medina Mosque.",

  aboutHalalTravelP: 'Halal Tourism in English is Halal Tourism. Refers to the Muslims follow the norms of Islam to travel around the world.',
  aboutHalalTravelP2: 'Including meals, there must be a Halal restaurant, relevant equipment provided by the hotel (Koran, prayer rugs, signs of the direction of Qibla in Mecca, purification facilities, local daily prayer time, etc.), Islamic knowledge and Etiquette, understanding Muslim taboos, etc.',
  aboutHalalTravelP3: 'The hotel does not serve alcoholic beverages and has separate pools and spa facilities for men and women. Malaysia, Turkey and many more countries are working hard to attract Muslim tourists from all over the world and provide religious facilities for Muslim tourists. No alcohol or pork products are served on air flights in the halal tourism industry, and prayers and in-flight entertainment are regularly announced to broadcast religious programmes.',

  message1: 'It turns out that halal can be seen everywhere in Taiwan. The restaurant is very suitable for few friends chatting and food sharing. There is a dining table in the semi-indoor space. Although the appearance looks a bit scary, it tastes very special and delicious. It is recommended to eat when served up and I am sure to bring friends to eat next time!',
  message2: 'I found time to come to the manufacturing place of Love Umbrella. I didn’t expect it to be a unique town. Walking in Hemei Town, there is a beautiful installation art combining colorful paintings and umbrellas, which makes people feel in Madrid’s Umbrella Alley. The second pseudo went abroad to fly to Spain, with the leisurely atmosphere of the small town, take a slow walk, take a walk and take a look. You can also give yourself a comfortable and leisurely picnic time, enjoy food here, take picnic photos, enjoy the comfortable sunshine, lie on the turf, and time is quietly stolen.',
  message3: 'Last year, we had 4 families and 3 children in our group. It was the first time to bring elders with the group. It was worth it. The children loved it. There were many experience activities. This time I experienced tea ceremony and yukata. And the introduction of the utensils. After the experience, there are still small points to taste. It is very worthwhile to experience it. There are also many styles of yukatas to choose from. It is highly recommended.',
  message4: 'The waiters are super kind! The price is also very affordable, which is a good place for children to stroll. The children worked here and played for more than an hour. The children were super happy. They also visited the teahouse for dinner. , taste Taiwanese cuisine, which is very authentic and has a strong ancient flavor.',
  message5: "A park that can't be reached by car is the original Yosemite. In the summer holidays, there are also aboriginal song and dance performances, which increase the joy of the park, which is great. The last time my friends went to the waterfall, many people had to line up on holidays, but I still had a good time. The old street was also rich and a lot of food, and I had a lot of fun eating it.",
